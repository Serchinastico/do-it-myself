# Template Directory

This `template` directory contains two different versions of the HTML files used in this project. These HTML files are
later compiled using Vite. The two files differ slightly to cater to different use-cases in the project. One is used for
the Manual tool and the other for the Worklog tool. They differ slightly in the CSS applied to both.
